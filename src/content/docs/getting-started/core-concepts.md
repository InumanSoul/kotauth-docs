Kotauth maps IAM concepts to five building blocks. Understanding how they relate to each other makes everything else — the auth flows, the API, the admin console — click into place.

## Workspace (Tenant)

A workspace is the top-level isolation boundary. Think of it as a realm or tenant. Every resource in Kotauth — users, applications, roles, groups, SMTP settings, signing keys — belongs to exactly one workspace. The same email address can exist independently in two different workspaces; they are completely separate identities.

You reference a workspace by its **slug** — a URL-safe identifier you choose when creating it. The slug appears in every URL:

```
/t/{slug}/login
/t/{slug}/.well-known/openid-configuration
/t/{slug}/api/v1/users
```

A single Kotauth instance handles as many workspaces as you need. The master workspace is reserved for platform administration.

## Application (OAuth Client)

An application is an OAuth2 client registered in a workspace. It represents a piece of software — a web app, mobile app, or backend service — that authenticates users or requests tokens from Kotauth.

Applications have two access types:

**Public** — no client secret. Used for single-page apps (SPAs) and mobile apps where a secret cannot be kept confidential. Must use PKCE with the Authorization Code flow.

**Confidential** — has a client secret. Used for server-side apps and backend services. Can use either the Authorization Code flow or the Client Credentials flow.

Each application has a list of allowed **redirect URIs** — Kotauth will only redirect back to these exact URIs after authorization.

## User

A user is an identity within a workspace. Users have a username, email, password (bcrypt-hashed), display name, and optional MFA enrollment. They can be enabled or disabled — disabling a user prevents login but preserves all data.

Users can be created by admins via the REST API or the admin console. They can also self-register if the workspace allows it, or be created automatically via social login.

## Role and Group

**Roles** are named permissions. They come in two scopes:

- `TENANT` scope — applies across the entire workspace. Useful for things like `admin`, `moderator`, or `viewer`.
- `CLIENT` scope — applies only within a specific application. Useful for fine-grained permissions that are meaningful only to one service.

**Groups** provide a hierarchy. A group can have a parent group, creating a tree. Users can be added to groups, and users inherit all roles assigned to their group and all ancestor groups. This lets you model organizational structures (e.g. `Engineering > Backend > On-call`) without manual role assignment per user.

Role assignments surface in issued access tokens as JWT claims:

```json
{
  "realm_access": {
    "roles": ["admin", "viewer"]
  },
  "resource_access": {
    "my-api": {
      "roles": ["orders:write"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Token

Kotauth issues three types of tokens:

**Access token** — a short-lived RS256-signed JWT (default: 5 minutes, configurable per application). Contains identity claims (`sub`, `email`, `name`), role claims, and standard OIDC claims. Verified by resource servers using the workspace's public key from the JWKS endpoint — no network call to Kotauth required.

**Refresh token** — a long-lived opaque token (default: 24 hours). Stored as a SHA-256 hash in the database. Exchanged at the token endpoint for a fresh access token and a new refresh token (rotation). Invalidated on use — possession of an old refresh token triggers session revocation.

**ID token** — a JWT issued alongside the access token containing the authenticated user's identity claims. Consumed by the client application, not resource servers.

## API Key

API keys authenticate machine-to-machine calls to the REST API. They are created in the admin console per workspace and carry a set of **scopes** (e.g. `users:read`, `roles:write`) that define which operations the key may perform. Keys are prefixed with `kauth_<slug>_` for easy identification in logs.

## How it fits together

```
Workspace (my-app)
├── Application: web-frontend   (public, Authorization Code + PKCE)
├── Application: backend-api    (confidential, Client Credentials)
├── User: alice@example.com
│   ├── Role: admin             (tenant scope)
│   └── Group: Engineering
│       └── Role: deploy        (tenant scope, inherited)
├── Role: admin
├── Role: deploy
├── Group: Engineering
└── API Key: ci-deploy-key      (scopes: users:read, sessions:write)
```

When Alice logs in through `web-frontend`, she gets an access token with `realm_access.roles: ["admin", "deploy"]`. When `backend-api` authenticates with Client Credentials, it gets a token representing the service itself, not any user.
